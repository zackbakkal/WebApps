			</header>
			
			<p>For this project, you are required to develop a web application that can provide users with 
			the following utility tools:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Measurement converters: weights, lengths, areas, and volumes</li>
				<li>A mortgage calculator</li>
				<li>A utility tool that you think could be useful. You may need to do some 
				research on the Web to build this last tool, and in the report you need to justify why you 
				think it will be useful.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In order to get full marks for the above design and implementation, the following are 
			required:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>It must have an integrated and user-friendly interface for users to access each of 
				the tools you designed.</li>
				<li>You need to use JavaScript functions and built-in objects to implement the 
				application.</li>
				<li>At any time only one tool will be shown, to ensure a clean and tidy space for users 
				to work with.</li>
				<li>You need to use Ajax technologies to eliminate whole page update when switching 
				from one utility to another.</li>
				<li>You need to use event handler to calculate and show the result as soon as the user 
				has given enough input to the system.</li>
				<li>In the assignment report, you need to provide sufficient documentation for your 
				work, including algorithms and formulas used for the tools. If you have used any 
				resources, including documents on the Web, you must clearly identify the source in 
					your documentation.</li>
			</ol>
